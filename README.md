# Nolvus Mod Installation Automator

## Overview

This project provides a simple automation script using AutoIt and Nolvus to streamline the process of installing mods for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim without the need for a Nexus Premium account. The script automates the tedious steps involved in mod installation, making it user-friendly and accessible to everyone. The code is not perfect and prone to error but it will help you speed up the process.
